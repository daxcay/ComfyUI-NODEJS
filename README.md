# ComfyUI-NODEJS

This node allows the execution of Node.js application within ComfyUI by leveraging the **ComfyUI-NODEJS**, which starts alongside ComfyUI and facilitates the installation of Node.js. The integration enables Python subprocesses to execute Node.js scripts.

## Features:

- Node.js Installer: An semi-automated installation process of nodejs for windows users only.
- Package Installer: Supports the installation and automatic updating of Node.js packages upon each startup.
- Multiple scripts Execution: Enables running multiple projects simultaneously.
- Graceful Shutdown: The service terminates when ComfyUI exits.

## Configuration

```ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-NODEJS\nodejs```

**To run a project successfully verify the below steps carefully.**

### Project structure to be followed

Every project should have two mandatory files in root folder one **app.js** and another **package.json** like this

**app.js** is just for representation actual name could be anything. (main.js, foo.js). 
but in package.json file mention correct name.

**package.json** looks something like this:

```
{
  "name": "project1",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev" : "node dev.js",
    "production" : "node app.js",
    "test": "node test.js"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.19.2"
  }
}
```

Ensure your project package.json to have a "production" script in scripts objects.

Now run/restart **comfyui**. 

Open any browser and head to ```http://localhost:3000```. If NodeJs is installed successfully it should return:
